# Minebuild
An original voxel engine with no relation to any current game. <br>
<br>
Client and server well documented and open to be manipulated in anyway you want. <br>
Built to support custom behaviour (mods) and shaders in the future. <br>
Built more like minecraft bedrock as i prefer how smooth bedrock feels compared to java. (Personal Opinion: Cope) <br>
<br>
The backend for the client is currently polygl.
The backend of the networking (client && server) is done by netc.
<br>
Thanks to using netc both server and client optionally support connection through ssl/tls encryption through openssl. <br>
