# Local (Unsafe) Server
### // ---- NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLIC SERVERS ---- //
This is the fastest server supported mainly for games by yourself, local or with your friends. <br>
If you want to create a public server check out /safe_server instead. <br>
<br>
The server will hold almost nothing, it exists to help with split screen development and local games. <br>
